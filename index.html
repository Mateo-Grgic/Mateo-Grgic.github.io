            <h2>About The Gadfly</h2>
            <p>The Gadfly is an independent satirical newspaper. Student-first & student-run, while we technically operate at LHSS as a 'club', we still operate by ourselves (with slight oversight & ocasional edits). We attempt to deliver amusing content, interesting ideas, and high-quality writing.</p>

            <div class="timeline-item">
                <h3>May 2025 - The Beginning</h3>
                <p>The story of The Gadfly begins with '<a href="pages/backcast.html" class="subtle-link">The Backcast</a>', a satirical newspaper with largely the same spirit as The Gadfly, but unrefined (and unsanctioned). Our first issue was released in May of 2025.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="timeline-item">
                <h3>June 2025 - The Fall</h3>
                <p>The Backcast continued the next month. In June 2025, issue #2 of The Backcast was published. Due to a combination of effects (Being unsanctioned, printing slightly controversial things, putting up posters whilst being unsanctioned, etc) The Backcast was formally shut down.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="timeline-item">
                <h3>Summer Break 2025 - The Rise</h3>
                <p>After a small party to celebrate the life & times of The Backcast, we decided to continue the paper officially. We originally planned on calling our paper 'The Outcast', but out of concern that the name might sound too similar to Backcast or Forecast, we decided to piviot entirely. And, like that, The Gadfly was born. We spent the summer crafting our founding docs, and writing our first issue.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="timeline-item">
                <h3>September 2025 - The Gadfly Today</h3>
                <p>With our heads held high, our newspaper & founding docs in hand, we met with our principal as soon as possibly possible. He graciously allowed us to continue, even with our stipulations of not being a club in the traditional manner (not allowing people in freely, no club fair, etc); we thank him greatly for this. We found a teacher sponsor whom meshed well with The Gadfly, and after minor revisions & edits, we published our first issue under The Gadfly name.</p>
