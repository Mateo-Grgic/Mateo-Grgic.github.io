    <h1>The Gadfly Official Style Guide</h1>
    <p class="document-meta">By Hassan Ahmed, Mateo Grgić, & Lianne Elkadri</p>

    <div class="article-section">
        <p>To maintain integrity and consistency within The Gadfly, the Steering Committee has drafted a style guide. Whilst the style guide is not binding in the way that The OAoAfTG is, it's still strongly recommended that you follow it to a tee. Articles & other Gadfly-related things will be minimally amended to comply with the guide.
          
        </p>
    </div>

    <div class="article-section">
            <h2>Content Guidelines</h2>
            <h3>Consent is Key</h3>
            <p>Everyone who is in the region, or from the region needs express consent to be featured in the paper. They must see one of the final drafts of the piece they're in and will ideally provide recorded consent to be in the section. Don't bother asking a political leader for consent though, as per standard journalist practices, it's not required.</p>

            <h3>We Have to Follow the Law</h3>
            <p>Anything that breaks the law has to be removed. This extends to school board policy as well. Sensationalist language involving harm or violence, if it is included, has to be cartoonish in nature and cannot be disturbing to read for anyone; in other words, stay PG.</p>

            <h3>Keep Personal Grudges Outside of the Newspaper</h3>
            <p>Even if someone you know has done something extremely wrong, the newspaper is not a place for you to rail against them and their actions.</p>

            <h3>Avoid In-Jokes & Vulgar Language</h3>
            <p>In-jokes aren't funny to readers outside of the team. Use of vulgar language will diminish any impact you may have had, and make the entire paper look unprofessional.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="article-section">
            <h2>Our Tone</h2>

            <h3>Stay Rebellious, Unapologetic, and Anti-Authoritarian</h3>
            <p>If you couldn't tell, this publication doesn't like authority. Follow content guidelines, but don't be apologetic otherwise. Be as rebellious as you can, the group will reel you back in if you go too far.</p>

            <h3>Be Fun and Witty</h3>
            <p>What's the point in reading our newspaper if we aren't funny? Keep the content interesting, witty, and entertaining. We would prefer you didn't write anything, than write something low quality.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="article-section">
            <h2>Formatting Standards</h2>

            <h3>Language</h3>

            <h2>What We Are Not</h2>

            <h3>We Are Not The Forecast, or a Clone of It</h3>
            <p>The Forecast is a different newspaper with different goals. We are not them, and we have no problem with members of this paper joining The Forecast. In our view, The Gadfly and The Forecast are complementary papers that do not need to compete with each other.</p>

            <h3>We Are Not The Onion, or a Clone of It</h3>
            <p>While we share some minor similarities, we are not The Onion. The Onion is political, we are not always. Do not try to write like The Onion, write like The Gadfly. The Onion is also usually not very funny; mostly duds. If you are going to plagiarise, at least steal from The Beaverton.</p>

            <h3>We Are Not a Magazine</h3>
            <p>We do not have one set theme, we do not rely on gossip, and we do not rely solely on illustrations or images. Your words should carry the message. Images can be used, but used sparingly.</p>

            <h3>We Are Not a Repository of Information</h3>
            <p>Basic terms do not need to be defined. This is not a dictionary, an encyclopaedia, or any trusted source of knowledge. Assume readers have a basic understanding of the thing you are about to satirise.</p>

        <h1>How to Write 'Gadfly-esque' Satire</h1>
        <p class="document-meta">By Mateo Grgić</p>

        <p style="margin-bottom: 2rem;">There are generally 4 main steps to writing good satire: Find your target, Choose a lens or a Satirical Frame, Commit to the bit (keep a straight face), and Add details & build the world. I'll go into some depth with all 4 steps. Of course, satire isn't an absolute thing, and these rules aren't set in stone; feel free to modify & deviate from this framework. It's meant to be a starting point of sorts, to show you what good, conventional satire looks like, and to provide a quality way to write satire.</p>

        <div class="article-section">
            <h2>Step One: Find Your Target</h2>
            <p>Almost all good satire starts with a shared observation. You often don't want to try to be funny just yet, just figure out something that is illogical, absurd, frustrating, etc that people will relate to.</p>

            <p>Your target should almost never be a person. Generally stick to these types of ideas:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>A System</strong> — The 'education system', bureaucracy, etc</li>
                <li><strong>An Idea or trend</strong> — Latest fads, the way people talk, trends, etc</li>
                <li><strong>A Type of language</strong> — Corporate jargon, medical speak, advertisement exaggeration, etc</li>
                <li><strong>A Shared frustration</strong> — A notoriously bad local business, a confusing rule, something that doesn't work</li>
            </ul>

            <p><em>Example: Your 'target' probably shouldn't be a teacher, rather, the stereotypical idea of a 'Teacher'.</em></p>
        </div>

        <div class="article-section">
            <h2>Step Two: Choose Your Satirical Frame (Your Lens)</h2>
            <p>Now that you have your target, you need to attack it. Generally, the point of satire is to attack an idea indirectly. The satirical frame you use is your fictional scenario or voice you use to make a point. This is where your creativity shines.</p>

            <p>Some common satirical frames that are used are:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>A glowing review of something terrible</strong> — Find something bad and praise it in the language of a connoisseur.</li>
                <li><strong>A serious, scientific analysis of something trivial</strong> — Treat a stupid thing like something important, with the utmost academic and/or scientific seriousness.</li>
                <li><strong>'The Inversion'</strong> — E.G. Comparing an infant to a 30 year old; take a common argument and flip it on its head to show how ridiculous the argument actually is.</li>
                <li><strong>'The modest proposal' strategy</strong> — Propose a solution to a problem that seems logical, but is morally horrific, to demonstrate the true nature of a problem. (This one is based on Jonathan Swift's "A Modest Proposal", one of the best pieces of satire in western literature ever written.)</li>
                <li><strong>A leaked memo</strong> — A supposed confidential, internal document that displays the absurd or cyclical logic of an organisation you want to satirise.</li>
                <li><strong>Q&A</strong> — A Q&A that is supposed to clarify, but ends up confusing more than it helped.</li>
                <li><strong>A How-to guide</strong> — A step-by-step guide to do something impossible, ridiculous, useless, morally questionable, or otherwise silly.</li>
                <li><strong>Fish-out-of-water narrator</strong> — An outsider describes a common (or not common) situation from their perspective.</li>
                <li><strong>Literal interpretation</strong> — Take a common metaphor, idiom, piece of conversation, etc and treat it as reality or something serious.</li>
                <li><strong>Overly specific and niche expert</strong> — An article by, or an interview with a really specific niche expert on something useless or dumb.</li>
                <li><strong>Re-branding/press release</strong> — Re-branding something bad, old, and/or unpleasant as something fun & new, often using corporate jargon, etc.</li>
                <li><strong>An Open letter</strong> — A formal, often dramatic letter addressed to a concept, inanimate object, an institution, or something equally silly.</li>
                <li><strong>The straight-faced news report</strong> — Read: The Onion, The Beaverton.</li>
                <li><strong>Guest column</strong> — An opinion piece or something, by someone silly or absurd.</li>
                <li><strong>Academic abstract/Scientific study</strong> — You present a completely dry, obvious, or otherwise uninteresting finding in scientific jargon, using overly complicated language.</li>
                <li><strong>A Recipe</strong> — You know how this one works, make a recipe for something silly.</li>
                <li><strong>Reviews</strong> — Review of something silly, or something that can't be bought.</li>
            </ul>

            <p>These are just general, common ones. Talented satire writers often use multiple frames to create something new & original. You don't need to use any of these, and you can deviate as much as you like. They're just common & decent frames to use.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="article-section">
            <h2>Step 3: Commit to the Bit!!!</h2>
            <p>This is the most important rule; You aren't a comedian telling a joke, you are a straight-faced character in an absurd world. Your narrator should be completely unaware that what they are saying is completely insane. Don't break the fourth wall.</p>

            <ul>
                <li>Use formal language</li>
                <li>Avoid swearing</li>
                <li>Use proper sentence structure</li>
                <li>Be an 'Expert' (unless otherwise required)</li>
                <li>Never Wink (Don't use sarcasm, don't tell the reader that this is a joke)</li>
            </ul>

            <p>The funny-ness of satire comes from the reader connecting the dots themselves. Don't spell it out.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="article-section">
            <h2>Step 4: Write the Darn Thing</h2>
            <p>Now it comes time to actually write your satirical piece. A single joke can get boring and tedious, so build a world for your reader. Populate your absurd world with little jokes and details; fake statistics, strange facts, etc: All presented with an air of realism.</p>

            <ul>
                <li>Create jargon</li>
                <li>Invent facts</li>
                <li>Use sensory details</li>
            </ul>

            <p>Just be a good author generally. Get your article proofread by someone. I personally am almost always available to proofread, and I'm typically a good proof reader, if you can't find anyone to proofread for you.</p>
