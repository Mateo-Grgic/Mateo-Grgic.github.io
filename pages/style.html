    <h1>The Gadfly Official Style Guide</h1>
    <p class="document-meta">By Hassan Ahmed, Mateo GrgiÄ‡, & Lianne Elkadri</p>

    <div class="article-section">
        <p>To maintain integrity and consistency within The Gadfly, the Steering Committee has drafted a style guide. Whilst the style guide is not binding in the way that The OAoAfTG is, it's still strongly recommended that you follow it to a tee. Articles & other Gadfly-related things will be minimally amended to comply with the guide.
          
        </p>

    <div class="article-section">
            <h2>Content Guidelines</h2>
            <h3>Consent is Key</h3>
            <p>Everyone who is in the region, or from the region needs express consent to be featured in the paper. They must see one of the final drafts of the piece they're in and will ideally provide recorded consent to be in the section. Don't bother asking a political leader for consent though, as per standard journalist practices, it's not required.</p>

            <h3>We Have to Follow the Law</h3>
            <p>Anything that breaks the law has to be removed. This extends to school board policy as well. Sensationalist language involving harm or violence, if it is included, has to be cartoonish in nature and cannot be disturbing to read for anyone; in other words, stay PG.</p>

            <h3>Keep Personal Grudges Outside of the Newspaper</h3>
            <p>Even if someone you know has done something extremely wrong, the newspaper is not a place for you to rail against them and their actions.</p>

            <h3>Avoid In-Jokes & Vulgar Language</h3>
            <p>In-jokes aren't funny to readers outside of the team. Use of vulgar language will diminish any impact you may have had, and make the entire paper look unprofessional.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="article-section">
            <h2>Our Tone</h2>

            <h3>Stay Rebellious, Unapologetic, and Anti-Authoritarian</h3>
            <p>If you couldn't tell, this publication doesn't like authority. Follow content guidelines, but don't be apologetic otherwise. Be as rebellious as you can, the group will reel you back in if you go too far.</p>

            <h3>Be Fun and Witty</h3>
            <p>What's the point in reading our newspaper if we aren't funny? Keep the content interesting, witty, and entertaining. We would prefer you didn't write anything, than write something low quality.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="article-section">
            <h2>Formatting Standards</h2>

            <h3>Language</h3>
            <p>Spelling & grammar is to be in proper British English, not American or Canadian English.</p>

                <li>Size 10 Regular Open Sans for body text</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Fonts Used in the Newspaper</h3>

        <div class="article-section">
            <h2>What We Are Not</h2>

            <h3>We Are Not The Forecast, or a Clone of It</h3>
            <p>The Forecast is a different newspaper with different goals. We are not them, and we have no problem with members of this paper joining The Forecast. In our view, The Gadfly and The Forecast are complementary papers that do not need to compete with each other.</p>

            <h3>We Are Not The Onion, or a Clone of It</h3>
            <p>While we share some minor similarities, we are not The Onion. The Onion is political, we are not always. Do not try to write like The Onion, write like The Gadfly. The Onion is also usually not very funny; mostly duds. If you are going to plagiarise, at least steal from The Beaverton.</p>

            <h3>We Are Not a Magazine</h3>
            <p>We do not have one set theme, we do not rely on gossip, and we do not rely solely on illustrations or images. Your words should carry the message. Images can be used, but used sparingly.</p>

            <h3>We Are Not a Repository of Information</h3>
            <p>Basic terms do not need to be defined. This is not a dictionary, an encyclopaedia, or any trusted source of knowledge. Assume readers have a basic understanding of the thing you are about to satirise.</p>
