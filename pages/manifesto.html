                <h2>Introduction</h2>
                <p>The student is trapped. Ahead lies the purgatory of university. After that, endless servitude in the career. The days blur together until we reach our last. We are taught to frame our entire lives around The Career. At the same time, automation and impending climate disaster teach us that our future is not guaranteed, and a career in that future even less so. But it doesn't have to end this way. We look at the position we're in right now, and it is clear that we cannot accept the conditions that brought us here. They have to be rejected; it is a matter of survival. There are many ways of rejecting the status quo; some grand and some small, some violent and some peaceful, some revolutionary and some reformist. The Gadfly is a satirical newspaper. It will not change the world; it does not claim or aim to do such. That being said, it seems to us clear that the current power structures do not permit us to run a free paper. As small as this publication is bound to be, its past iteration elicited a punitive reaction that risks any future project. The newspaper's impact will always be limited, so it may seem strange for us to have a constitution, style guide, and manifesto. Our reason for all these is simple. Whenever anything is ever done, a rational reason can be engineered to explain why that course of action was taken. Sometimes that reason is baked into the decision-making, and sometimes that reason is discovered after the fact. We aim to have the former; it informs our decisions and keeps them in line with our principles.</p>

                <p>Any action worth actualising stands on a foundation forged by a prefigurative struggle for a new public environment; an environment built around freedom and democracy. Ultimately, our future will be <em>prefiguratisme ou barbarisme</em>. Short of any practical change, The Gadfly aims to display a couple truths. In the face of abject hopelessness, we can create things of our own, and we can organise a system that reflects our vision for the future. The implementation of those principles can be changed through a deeper analysis of history, as we learn & study the ways that past movements have succeeded and the ways that they failed. Without Hannah Arendt's study on totalitarianism following her escape from Nazi Germany, Murray Bookchin and later Abdullah Öcalan would never have written their findings on what it means to be free. Without the Situationist International, political student-run newspapers would still be fringe. All these sources inform our theory and praxis, and show that history does not operate in a vacuum. Our interpretations often fall outside the majority interpretation but aren't without respectable backing. Though we often disagree with the historical consensus, we still do our best to respect the iterative nature of historical study. With that being said, we are not amateur historians but rather amateur political theorists. Our use of history is simply a means to an end. History in this context is used to aid a point, and as such our ventures into history are unfortunately shallow. If anything piques your interest we can provide more information or some of the sources that inspired our interpretation. This is a manifesto, and our in-text references will be limited to political theorists. All that to say, if there's something you don't like, take it up with Guy Debord.</p>

                <p>The Friendly Manifesto for The Gadfly seeks to lay out our diagnosis for society's ills, contrast these with our ideals, and then our principles that aim to implement those ideals. Along the way, we will provide historical context for our positions and respond to common criticisms that are levied against our beliefs. This answers the 'why' of The Gadfly, and will frequently reference the Official Articles of Agreement for The Gadfly (OAoAfTG). It is not required to memorise that document to understand this manifesto, but it's well worth a read.</p>

                <h2>Problems</h2>
                <p>In this section, we will lay out our diagnosis of society's shortcomings as it relates to the student. Hierarchies, in all their forms, are abused against us. We will begin with theories on the establishment of formal hierarchy, most notably the state. We'll then focus on the often overlooked informal hierarchy structure, most notably The Career. We'll examine how these hierarchies manufacture calamities for the young or otherwise undesirable, in favour of greater riches for the fortunate.</p>

                <h3>2a. The State and Formal Hierarchy</h3>
                <p>In May 1968, students from Nanterre university organised a protest against poor conditions and repression from both the government and the university. Inspired by the 1966 movement in the University of Strasbourg, they aimed to promote the ideal of freedom. Police, directed by the state, shut down the campus and expelled protesting students from the area. Not long after, the protest moved to Sorbonne and escalated quickly. Fearing further crackdowns, students erected barricades to protect themselves from armed officers, though clashes in the streets between police and students continued through the nights. By the 13th of May, some 2 weeks after the students had begun their assembly, the labour movement joined them. Roughly 60% of the national workforce went on strike; it was the largest strike in French history. The De Gaullist regime did not take kindly to this hint of rebellion from his subjects. After briefly fleeing to West Germany, De Gaulle came back to crush the movement. The military was called to take control in Paris, the National Assembly was dissolved, and the government threatened to invoke martial law. After labour leaders betrayed the students by reaching a separate deal, the strike ended. The military closed in on the students and the movement collapsed by the 23rd of June.</p>

                <p>The reason for the failure of the 1968 protest is complicated. Had the labour movement continued to work with the students, and if the government chose to respect the will of the people, perhaps the protests would have been more successful. The reason the ideal of freedom failed, in any case, was because of the state. The state granted itself the exclusive right to kill, coerce, and intimidate; powers that it readily used against the students. The state is a formal hierarchy.</p>

                <p>Unlike the (adult) worker, who is beholden to the state but granted relative freedom in their public spaces, the same cannot be said for the student. For many, the school is the principal public space, which gives the school administration, acting in their capacity as enforcers of the state's will, a uniquely powerful position over the social lives of their children. The student has little freedom of speech, assembly, and association. Alarmingly, the right to "security of the person" is increasingly being called into question. Worst of all, the student is seldom given justice, and certainly not as a right. The right of justice is an important one, for if it fails, the other rights cannot be upheld.</p>

                <p>There is no way to dispute a violation of one's rights without justice. The fact is that the school administration can pull us out of class for any reason, and we are expected to pay the consequences of any missed time. We do not have the right to a speedy conclusion, in fact, the school administration can keep you for as long as they would like before even speaking to you. By law they must inform the guardian of a suspension following an incident, and only then are our rights respected. This, whether intentional or not, dehumanises the student and treats them as a dependent instead of an autonomous individual. Punitive justice is employed because it coerces into compliance. With this threat looming over the student's head, perhaps they will think again about organising a protest during school hours, perhaps they will rethink spending time with their friend who has been in trouble with the office before, perhaps they'll realise that this space isn't a safe, inclusive space after all; the rights of assembly and association recede without justice. Security is a separate problem, which merits itself to serious analysis. What we will say here is that the primary advantage of strict rules and punitive justice is that it supposedly keeps people safe. This is not the case, not anymore. We can see across the country that there has been a significant rise in violence directed towards students and teachers alike. Just as always, punitive justice fails. Public Schools, as extensions of the state, mimic its coercive tendencies to maintain an atmosphere of dominance. Ending this veneer of superiority is a worthwhile effort all students ought to engage in.</p>

                <h3>2b. The Career and Informal Hierarchy</h3>
                <p>The bulk of serious analysis on resistance is focused on formal hierarchies. This is for good reason; they are the most universal, and the most powerful. However, if our aim is to establish a free and democratic future, narrow focus on just formal power structures would be fatal to our understanding. Informal hierarchies make up the vast majority of unequal power relations. They are too numerous to count, and many political scientists have defined and labeled these hierarchies for millenia. The Spectacle, white hegemony, and patriarchy are all examples of power structures that lack visible chains of command; what we call informal hierarchies. For freedom to prevail, these must be abolished. The informal hierarchy we are most concerned with in this context is The Career.</p>

                <p>The Career is a relatively new phenomenon. It has its roots in the Early Modern Era, where prestigious professions such as law and medicine became available to the wider upper class. Before this, occupations were tied to caste; a man from a generation of farmers would most likely never do anything but farm. This began to shift in the 19th century. With the onset of the Industrial Revolution in the United Kingdom, many poor farmers flocked to cities for factory jobs. The Career was born. The idea of meritocracy was created; the false notion that hard work was linked to social mobility. As has been made abundantly clear in the centuries that followed, meritocracy is a lie, as the fortunate will always have more resources than the less fortunate. Barring pure chance, nepotism and paid experience are more likely to determine success in The Career than good effort. Still, this separated it from past conceptions of work; you could now theoretically join the aristocracy through nothing but the work of your own hands. This would create the supply, but with little demand, The Career hadn't come to dominate every aspect and decision of one's life. This would take time to evolve. For the vast majority of humans across history, money went into the bare necessities. Of course special occasions warranted celebration, but the average lifestyle of most humans was not a consumerist one. This would change in the 19th and 20th centuries. The commercialisation of creative work, the advertising industry permeating every public space, and the lobbying of the state by large multinationals, slowly shifted western society away from a scarcity mindset and towards a consumerist one. It would be accurate to say that Descartes' <em>Cogito Ergo Sum</em> has been replaced with <em>Emo Ergo Sum</em>. Likewise, if something cannot be sold, it is a fruitless exercise in misery. Commodities, roles, and veneers replaced human connection; all hail the age of The Spectacle.</p>

                <p>It should be noted that different hierarchies are necessarily interconnected. They compliment each other, which is exactly why the elimination of all hierarchies is necessary. As an example, the dehumanisation of the non-white and the objectification of women are informed, in part, by The Career and The Spectacle. As the patriarchy placed the levers of power in the hands of men, it is men who become the default and women as a sort of lesser being. Lest we forget, for a wife to rebel against her husband used to carry the legal penalty of treason. Women became commodities, and standards of beauty forced them into a product to be sold. In the traditional power structure of the patriarchy, it is the role of men to work and for women to tend to the home. As The Career defines what is and isn't worthy of being celebrated, this elevates the role of men to a class undoubtedly higher than women. Even as women entered the sphere of work, the attitudes and prejudices against them remain. For the non-white, they have long been considered a commodity in Canada. The Brutish Black, the Disciplined Oriental, and the Savage Indian, these appearances are crafted by the market to create convenient caricatures that, though they can be framed as positive, still commodify and dehumanise. It is for this reason that, though feminist and anti-racist movements have made great strides throughout the 20th and 21st centuries, they can never fully succeed until all hierarchies have been dismantled.</p>

            <section class="article-section">
                <h2>Ideals</h2>
                <p>In this section, we seek to define what our ideals are, how they combat the ills we discussed in section 2, and address common criticisms of those ideals. The purpose of these ideals is to have an abstract, 'archetypal', Gadfly. One that we can strive towards. Even if the principles change, the ideals can continue to guide us. The Gadfly finds itself on two fundamental ideals: Freedom and Democracy. These terms have been serially abused by the authority that respects neither. We define freedom and democracy respectively as the following:</p>

                <p><strong>The full ability to engage or disengage in activity without fear of coercion</strong></p>
                <p><strong>The actualisation of universal participation through free deliberation</strong></p>

                <h3>3a. Freedom</h3>
                <p>Our definition of freedom can be broken down into three parts. Ability, activity, and coercion. All parts of our definition are informed by the historical record, synthesising different definitions of freedom & liberty from movements across time.</p>

                <p>By 1941, the German Reich had achieved unprecedented success in the build-up to and the outbreak of the Second World War. Austria, Czechoslovakia, Poland, The Netherlands, Belgium, Luxembourg, Norway, and France had all been defeated without much effort. The Weimar Republic had given way to an autocratic, nationalist regime headed by the Nazi Party. As we established in section 2a, the state is more than willing to use its power in order to restrict freedom and gain power, in this case, over a third of the European Continent. The rise of the fascist regime in Germany could never have achieved its gains without assistance from the colonial entente powers during the 1919 Peace Conference. The Treaty of Versailles severely wounded the freedom of the German people. It brought about economic collapse as the Weimar Republic struggled to pay back its war dues. Without the humiliation, hunger, and slavery of want onset by the end of WWI, the conditions necessary for the Nazis to gain control would not have been present. In other words, by creating a hierarchy between the German and Entente states, the conditions were created for the hierarchy between the German State and its people to grow. President Franklin D. Roosevelt of The United States recognised this. In his 1941 State of The Union Address, he makes the case for the reduction of hierarchy, in order to prevent authority from gaining total power, when he says that "the basic things expected by our people of their political and economic systems are simple. They are: Equality of opportunity for youth and for others. Jobs for those who can work. Security for those who need it. The ending of special privilege for the few."</p>

                <p>It is from this need to reduce hierarchy that the first part of our definition, "ability", comes into play. Though FDR fails to recognise the hierarchy of The Career, his underlying message rings true. No one can truly be free if they are shut out from society, if they are at serious risk of death, or if all opportunity and privilege belongs to authority. No one is completely independent from their society. Everything they do is in some sense, dictated by the practices that surround them. Thus, it should follow that it is every person's right to influence the make-up of their society, with every person being equally entitled to the capacity for change. Why then do the wealthy have a greater input into the societal process? It seems that even in youth, some are destined to succeed and most are destined to fail. The latter group's right to freedom and input are restricted, and the society fails to be free. In a similar fashion, people on the verge of death cannot be expected to care about freedom more than they care about survival. This near-universal truth has been exploited by the state for millenia; by starving a people into submission, they can restrict freedom and maintain power. No human can take action when they are hungry, the need to survive takes precedence over everything else. Even when the people are granted some freedom, if a ruling class has more than the servile class, their ability is hindered. Someone with more can do more, including limiting the freedoms again of the one with less. Hierarchy poses a direct threat to ability.</p>

                <p>Activity refers to the three categories that all things done by all living things can be put into; labour, work, and action. To engage in activity is to engage in life; this must be protected as a fundamental right. As activity has been increasingly replaced by a consumerist lifestyle, Freedom is put at risk.</p>

                <p>Labour are the collection of activities that keep humans alive (Eating, sleeping, etc.). If the activities of labour are not satisfied, it is impossible to focus on anything else. For some activities, labour is the natural category. The farmer labours to make food, and the engineer labours to make shelter. For other occupations, they are forced to artificially fit this mold. Education is not a point of immediate survival, yet the teacher is forced to play the labouring game in order to survive. The further divorced an individual's labour is from humanity's immediate survival, the less it is respected. The doctor and the trash collector both serve a principal role in preventing disease, yet they are opposites in terms of status. In the context of the student, labour is the academic space of school; though necessary, it should not be all-encompassing if our goal is to build a well-rounded adult population. Work are the things that humans create that outlast them. Art, architecture, and history are all examples of work. A society where the public either cannot or does not care to be inspired by grand works of art, nor learn from the annals of history, are the conditions in which totalitarian rule is created. To save work as a human activity requires either abolishing the system that controls it, or separating work from the commodity regime. Again looking through the lens of the student, work is the domain of the school club. Though overly regulated, limited in scope, and ad-hoc in nature, these clubs provide at least some level of work for students to engage in. Finally, Action. Perhaps the most difficult to parse, is the place in which humanness resides. Whereas animals engage in labour and some do engage in work, action is a uniquely human activity. Action is free, spontaneous interaction with other humans. Spontaneity is the force that drives freedom; without the freedom to be and not be, there is no desire to be human. The school, and society at large, rejects action as disorderly: antithetical to an orderly society. For the student, this manifests itself in spontaneous student organisation; strictly against school policy. Humanisation and freedom are not privileges that are granted to the student.</p>

                <p>The full ability to engage or disengage in activity is the foundation of freedom. It protects what Isaiah Berlin describes as 'positive liberty'. As far as negative liberty is concerned, this definition does not go far enough. Freedom is conditional on the fact that no one can force another being into engaging or disengaging. Without fear of coercion, everyone can be free. It is well worth noting that this doesn't just condemn coercive practices, but also the psychological threat that inevitably arises whenever a power imbalance is formed. Even if a benevolent dictator did not coerce anyone into doing his will, the self-evident truth that the dictator has this power in the beginning is enough for this to violate another's freedom. For full freedom, equality is necessary.</p>

                <h3>3a.(I). Who Deserves Freedom?</h3>
                <p>A common objection to freedom is that, simply put, not everyone deserves it. To reject freedom as a whole is not a position most hold, instead they view the right to freedom as conditional to education, age, compliance, or any number of other factors. This view, shaped by a flawed understanding of democracy, leads to not a democratic society but an authoritarian one.</p>

                <p>Infamously, in 1775, a shot was heard around the world. The battles of Lexington and Concord were won by the patriots, who would soon formalise into the Continental Army. The revolution started in 1775 would establish the loftiest attempt at democracy since Athens; The United States of America. Following 8 years of war, the American Alliance successfully defeated the British Empire. The founders of the United States were intelligent men. Deep in enlightenment thought, they fell in love with the ideal of individuality and the principle of secularisation. This led them towards democracy: a pre-christian, egalitarian form of organising society. Still, the founders of the United States were only men, and products of their time. Writing to her husband in 1776, Abigail Adams urged him to, "not put such unlimited power into the hands of the husbands", and to consider the fact that freedom cannot be conditional to sex. This plea fell on deaf ears. The United States of America, since its inception, has rejected freedom. It is clear that women did not have the full ability to engage in the society that ruled over them, that the existing hierarchy in the family unit was not challenged, and that the interest of the founding fathers was not in creating an equal society. The goal of some founders was not even to establish a democratic system, but an American kingdom. As a whole, the US government rejected the idea of suffrage for women and non-white residents. In the first 'election', less than 2% of the population voted. Only 5 states ran elections by popular vote. Of those, the right to vote was heavily restricted to even white men on account of property requirements. Though promising, it is hard to describe the American system as a democracy. Instead, the 'Revolutionary' War seemingly replaced one aristocracy with another. This view of democracy, of simply expanding the ruling class, continued to inform American democracy. It did not abolish the hierarchy of aristocracy, but simply attempted to make it more inclusive. By treating democracy as a simple expansion of aristocracy, it leaves the hierarchical power structure between the old aristocrats and the poorer class unchallenged, instead, it endorses this system of affairs by institutionalising it in the state. Most would agree that placing freedom as conditional to sex (and later gender) was a large mistake, yet the subjection of a minority in this manner is not an isolated case in the United States. How could it be when the system is designed for it?</p>

                <p>From the Civil Rights Movement in the 1960s, the major labour strikes in the 1970s, and all the way to the Queer liberation movement of the 1990s and into the 21st century, oppressed factions of the American population have had to fight for the right to freedom. Though none of these movements can ever fully succeed so long as they refuse to abolish the hierarchical systems that control them, they have at least gained recognition as free agents in their society. Why not the student then? Or the prisoner? Or any other group they continue to restrict freedom from? The difference between the recognised groups and the unrecognised is the fact that there has been no movement to emancipate the latter. This objection is nothing more than an appeal to the status quo. A brief look back in even our own lifetimes should show why the status quo cannot be trusted as an arbiter of moral judgement.</p>

                <h3>3b. Democracy</h3>
                <p>We have already touched on the intersection between freedom and democracy. Though related, they are distinct concepts. They are separable from each other and by treating them as one thing, we risk losing that distinction between the two. As an example, the democratic system used in Athens was very participatory, direct, and receptive to action; it was the purest democracy that the world has ever seen. Yet, the people of Athens couldn't be considered free. The concept of individual freedom was not mainstream, and indeed many citizens of Athens were servants and slaves. Our definition of democracy, the actualisation of universal participation through deliberation, can be broken into three parts. Actualisation, participation, and deliberation.</p>

                <p>Following the events of the February Revolution in Russia, elections were held to determine what the nation would look like following the end of the Empire. Viktor Chernov's Social Revolutionaries (SRs) won the plurality of seats with 37.6% of the vote. In second place was Vladimir Lenin's Bolshevik Party with just 23.3%. As the party with the most seats, Chernov's SRs should have led Russia for that session of The Assembly. Instead, The Assembly was dissolved by the Bolshevik Party after just 13 hours. It should be noted that a political system does not need an elected assembly to be democratic, and indeed it was the democratic soviet councils that overthrew The Assembly. However, these councils did not remain democratic for long as the USSR devolved towards totalitarianism. The fatal flaw of the Russian democracy was that it did not have means to enforce actualisation. The dual power structure of the Soviets and the Assembly would have caused conflict if ever the two came to ideological differences as they did in 1917. Actualisation is the practical qualifier; It is not enough for democracy to be professed, it must also be executed in a way that does not contradict itself nor compromise on its ideals. The Russian system fell prey to the former, and then the latter. The internal contradictions of the revolutionary Russian Government were so great that it created the conditions of its own collapse. By the end of Stalin's rule, the soviets were hardly as democratic as they could have been, because the USSR compromised on democracy. By abolishing the state's power or at the very least making it subservient to the independent soviets, the USSR could have established the strongest democracy in the world; instead, it created an authoritarian system, somehow more flawed than the American experiment.</p>

                <p>Universal Participation is an important aspect of democracy; how can it be rule by the people if the entire people do not rule? As was explored in previous sections, limiting the franchise to certain 'worthy' groups of people stands opposed to the very promise of democracy. It is an entirely selfish and self-patronising concept; that only you and the people that share one or two irrelevant characteristics with you give that group the right to rule over another. This concept of minority rule can be extended further. Universal Participation is necessary to prevent the capturing of the state by those with the most time and resources to influence the system. The Canadian federal system rejects participation in favour of representation, to the delight of lobbyists. The Canadian system, strangely authoritarian even amongst its fellow liberal nations, places an incredible trust in the Prime Minister. The Prime Minister, in a majority government, essentially has control over the House, Senate, Cabinet, and Supreme Court. By using their position of authority to coerce their fellow members of parliament, The Prime Minister maintains extensive control over their party. More than 8 and a half million Canadians voted for the Liberal Party in the 2025 general election. This resulted in 169 members being elected. Already a perversion of democracy by shutting out millions of Canadians from direct action, the control the leader maintains means that in essence, 8 and a half million voices were condensed into one. Is this democratic? Of course the Prime Minister can still be persuaded by those rich enough to have a platform, but so can a king. Canada has more in common with The British Empire than Athens. Is Canada a democracy? Without participation, it at times imitates democracy, but it is evidently not one. If any student-run parliament in school was run like the Canadian, it would be shut down as a grossly discriminatory and uninclusive dictatorship. Anything goes when you're in government.</p>

                <p>Deliberation, the final aspect of our definition, seems to be the most well understood part of democracy, and as such there isn't as much to argue here. It seems obvious to most that you cannot have a democratic system without the free dissemination of ideas. Representation in western democracy, as it does with most aspects of democracy, undermines and contradicts the very system it is said to be modeled on. As long as the state maintains the monopoly on violence, it does not have to listen to its people. By limiting deliberation to a small subset of the population that has been 'elected' by the people, the parliament can brush off the most important part of democracy; diversity of opinion. The House of Commons currently has 5 parties in parliament; 5 perspectives. It is evident that Canada has more than 5 people in it. If you were to ask all 40 million Canadians their opinions on an issue, you would get 50 million answers. Again, it must be evident that 50 million is larger than 5.</p>

                <p>For any democratic system to avoid a fatal contradiction without compromising on the ideal, they must actualise universal participation. The easiest way to do this is through free deliberation. The Gadfly has attempted to build this very system by rejecting the myth of necessary authority, building open deliberation and discussion rather than debate into every group-wide decision, and ensuring that discussion cannot begin without all relevant members present. Still, a common fear arises when true democracy is brought to the table: what about the Tyranny of the Majority?</p>

                <h3>3b.(I). Tyranny of the Majority?</h3>
                <p>2400 years ago, the original gadfly was executed by a mob for corrupting the youth of Athens; a text-book example of Tyranny of the Majority. The phantom of mobocracy is a large reason why the United States opted for three branches of government instead of a single legislative one. It is why marxist experiments created the concept of democratic centralism. Surely, if we accept that the tyranny of the majority is a real problem, then it follows that at least in some instances democracy needs to be limited to protect the people. The main flaw with this argument is that tyranny of the majority isn't so much a problem with democracy as it is a problem with centralisation and the state.</p>

                <p>The reason why tyranny of the majority is so dangerous is that it gives a majority the power to strangle the rights of a minority if it sees fit. It creates a hierarchy between the voting class and the minority, who can never hope to overturn the results of the majority. The solution is not, however, to limit democracy for everyone. Even in states that have restricted democracy (USA, USSR, etc.) minority populations continued to be repressed as the new authority that was established acted just as oppressive as the majority was said to have been. Instead, the solution is to decentralise. This is a point that will be expanded on further. For now though, it's important to note that if you take away the power that a state or group-wide assembly has and put that power into the hands of hyper-local or single-issue, independent assemblies, much of the problems with tyranny of the majority are lessened. Such a solution was invoked by the Rojavans in Syria, the Zapatistas in Mexico, and, to a lesser extent, the Nunavummiut in Canada. All have seen a greater protection of minorities than could have been achieved by relegating power to authority. Tyranny of the majority is solved by empowering the minority.</p>

            <section class="article-section">
                <h2>Principles</h2>
                <p>In this section, we seek to lay out our principles: Prefiguration, decentralisation, consensus, and independence. These Principles help guide The Gadfly towards a future where our ideals are actualised in the newspaper. By focusing on the future, we depart from history and create our own path. These principles may have to change as we approach new obstacles. That is ok. As long as our ideals remain firm, the principles can be flexible.</p>

                <h3>4a. Prefiguration</h3>
                <p>Prefiguratism as a term was coined in the 1990s, and describes an approach in which we focus on building the systems and relationships our future ideal promises us in the present.</p>

                <p>Workers in the first International Workingmen's Association faced a difficult division in 1876. On one side were the marxists who believed that in order to free the people of the state, it was first necessary to capture the state and establish a dictatorship of the proletariat. On the other side were the anarchists who, rightfully so, rejected the concept that the state could ever be used to bring about real liberation. Both factions would end trying to work together to establish their shared vision of the future. Today we can see the conclusions of their respective systems. On one side, North Korea, China, The USSR, and the Khmer Rouge all serve as stark reminders of what happens when the state is trusted with substantial power. On the other, Rojava, the Zapatistas, Ukraine, and Catalonia serve as hopeful glimpses into a world beyond tyranny.</p>

                <p>Prefiguration does not compromise with electoralism or revolutionary opportunism. It does not seek to reform hierarchical institutions that have brought nothing but misery upon us. By rejecting these methods and moving towards direct action, we can build the future in the present. This approach prevents freedom from being eroded in the name of pragmatism or later reform, because it insists that our means must match our ends. The Black Panther's early community kitchens, childcare systems, and non-hierarchical meetings were all examples of prefiguration. If we cannot live our values today, we are unlikely to live them tomorrow.</p>

                <h3>4a.(I). Is Prefiguration Utopian?</h3>
                <p>Prefiguration necessitates living the future in the present by creating the systems that we want to live in. This raises an obvious objection, isn't prefiguration utopian or unrealistic? The short answer is yes. Prefiguration is a utopian system, yet this doesn't make it unrealistic. Even if prefiguration is unrealistic, the alternative of praying for the future to come to us instead of actualising it ourselves is infinitely more wishful.</p>

                <p>Prefiguration always seems unworkable and impossible until it succeeds, and there are many examples of prefigurative politics achieving major wins. The greatest modern example is the Democratic Autonomous Administration of North and Eastern Syria (DAANES). The Kurdish people are a nation split between Turkiye, Iran, Iraq, and Syria. Since the Turkish war of independence, uprisings and rebellions aimed at Kurdish liberation have tried and failed to bring about an independent Kurdish state. Their attempts to end their oppression through the very vehicle of oppression was always bound to fail. Recognising this, the approach of the Kurdish Workers Party (PKK) pivoted in 2005 towards radical democracy; the PKK officially adopted Democratic Confederalism. As the name suggests, the ideology endorses a radical, consensus based democratic system by decentralising power to confederal councils. It was a promising system of thought in a region devoid of democracy. All that was left was to put it into action.</p>

                <p>As part of the Arab Spring in 2011, demonstrations began in Syria against the Ba'athist Assad regime. The demonstrations soon erupted into civil war. The Kurdish minority in Syria acted to protect itself from the Turkish-backed rebel regime, the Russian-backed government, and the Qatari-backed Islamic State. To onlookers, it seemed as though the Kurdish attempt to defeat three states simultaneously without serious support from a state itself was bound to collapse immediately. As of September 2025, the Assad government and the Islamic State have both been defeated, with a ceasefire agreed on between the former rebels and the DAANES. Today, though not perfect, DAANES stands as the most democratic nation in the middle east. Its protection of minorities, notably youth and women, are among the best in the region. The autonomous zone still faces challenges, notably on how to transition from a Kurdish commune to a multicultural society. Additionally, though there has been a large focus on Jineology and women's liberation, undoing centuries of violence against women continues to be a major struggle; violence and instability still plague the DAANES. Still, In just over a decade, they have built perhaps the most democratic society in the world by rejecting all hierarchies and prefigurating their society. Prefiguration is utopian, and that is exactly why it's worth fighting for.</p>

                <h3>4b. Decentralisation</h3>
                <p>After decades of oppression at the hands of the Turkish, Iranian, Iraqi, and Syrian states, the Kurdish sovereignty movement officially moved away from the goal of creating a state, and instead towards the goal of democratic confederalism. They had seen the way states, democratic or not, had abused their power to persecute the Kurdish minority. How do you avoid the tyranny that centralised power brings? The answer, as we discussed previously, is in decentralisation.</p>

                <p>Decentralisation takes power from a centralised authority and devolves it, so that all people can take reasonable action to better their society. This enables minorities, the weaker, and the disadvantaged to prefigurate a world that works for them. It ends the Tyranny of the Majority by abolishing the concept of a majority in the first place. Democracy can only be actualised when participation is universal.</p>

                <p>For The Gadfly, the deliberate devolution and distribution of key responsibilities creates a situation in which no one person can halt production, marketing, or printing by revoking their service. A key positive of decentralisation is that it builds in redundancy in case one person chooses to leave, and that it reduces the possibility of a hierarchy forming in the first place. Decentralisation also imposes a level of responsibility. Importantly, freedom to us does not mean freedom from effort or initiative. To the contrary, a good society requires every member to advance it with as much strength as they can provide. Whereas centralisation supports inaction and a sort of bystander effect (how often do people reject politics because they know their vote is useless?), decentralisation pushes power back into the hands of the people. Centralisation imposes, decentralisation liberates.</p>

                <h3>4c. Consensus</h3>
                <p>As part of Nunavut's creation as its own distinct territory in 1999, the region adopted a consensus government. Consensus rejects the myth of majoritarianism by mandating that all or nearly all members must approve a resolution before it passes.</p>

                <p>Consensus, as it relates to The Gadfly, is a form of democracy wherein a resolution can pass only if no member seriously objects to it; in other words, all members must at least reluctantly support a resolution for its passage. This can be contrasted with unanimity, which requires the complete support from every member, and most other democratic systems, which require 50% + 1. Serious objection is defined as an objection to a resolution that, if accepted, would fundamentally alter the purpose or implementation of the resolution. In the event of a serious objection, further negotiation and debate would be required. Preference is an example of a minor disagreement, something that would not require further debate if the objector has agreed to a lesser preference.</p>

                <p>Consensus can be contrasted against the form of majoritarian democracy that most people think of when it comes time to talk about voting. The simple fact is, that resolutions cannot be universal if only 50% + 1 are supporting them. Consensus promotes active, universal deliberation by letting everyone voice their concerns. Consensus gives people the power to engage with the decision-making systems in their community or organisation without having to worry about coercion from a political party.</p>

                <h3>4d. Independence</h3>
                <p>Freedom and democracy cannot survive if the institutions that uphold them are dependent on the goodwill of powerful actors. When a movement relies on external authority, whether financial, political, or social; it invites those actors to shape its priorities and compromise its values. History is littered with examples of once-principled organisations that became tools of the very systems they opposed, not through open conquest but through slow dependence. An institution that answers to a government agency, a corporate sponsor, or any other entrenched power is no longer accountable first to the people it claims to serve. Independence, then, is both a strategic necessity and a moral imperative. By preserving autonomy from outside influence, we protect our ability to act according to our own principles, to resist co-optation, and to ensure that our decisions reflect the needs of the community rather than the ambitions of those who would control it.</p>

                <h2>Conclusion</h2>
                <p>When we think of the great turning points in history, we often think of the flashy clashes; protesting, striking, revolting, reforming. We think of Stonewall, Occupy Wall Street, the Black Lives Matter Protests, etc. When someone brings up 'change', our minds seldom wander to the less exciting scenes of carefully planned decision-making structures or indeed, the existence of a satire student newspaper. What we have argued in this manifesto, is that achieving such lofty ideals and actualising principles are impossible without these kinds of things. It is not enough to reject systems but to support better ones. Of course The Gadfly cannot replace The Career, but it stands in direct opposition to everything that The Career dictates.</p>

                <p>We have diagnosed why the modern society is unfit for human use by pointing out the over-reliance on formal and informal hierarchies. We put forward our ideals of freedom and democracy, defend them from attack, and translate them into actionable principles to provide a guide: Prefiguration, decentralisation, consensus, and independence. We have explored historical parables that guide our understanding of the past and present. We hold ourselves to no set ideology, respecting and judging all previous attempts to establish a world built around our ideals and shaped by our principles.</p>

                <p>In writing this manifesto, we've aimed to make sense of our beliefs from a set of historical and current political practices. Though not primary, our analyses of history synthesise many different interpretations to create a more whole view of the world. Our conclusion of this is that, if humanness is to survive, it needs to transition away from the old hierarchies and embrace a more equal society. If The Student isn't yet trusted to change the world, we might as well change ourselves.</p>

                <h2>Further Reading</h2>
                <p>If you're interested, here are the books and authors that have an outsized impact on the positions of this manifesto.</p>

                <h3>Hannah Arendt</h3>
                <p><em>The Origins of Totalitarianism, The Human Condition</em></p>
                <p>Hannah Arendt was a German born American social theorist. Following a brief imprisonment by the Gestapo, Arendt fled to France in 1933. As a jewish woman, she was again forced to flee in 1941, this time to The United States. It took time for her to find respect in the American academic circle. Her analysis on totalitarianism and man's general disposition have been invaluable to our understanding here. Hannah Arendt, more than anyone else, inspired the creation of The Gadfly. If you are familiar with Arendt's works, you will definitely be able to see her influence in this manifesto. Her understanding of the Vita Activia, her approach to understanding Athenian democracy, and her analysis on the USSR are particular points of reference for us.</p>

                <h3>Murray Bookchin</h3>
                <p><em>Post-Scarcity Anarchy, The Next Revolution</em></p>
                <p>Murray Bookchin was an American political philosopher, best known as a trailblazer of the environmental movement. Bookchin identified as an anarchist until the late 90s, where, seeing the apoliticisation that was endemic to the American left, renounced the label. He took a prefigurative approach from then on, founding the libertarian municipalist line of thought. Bookchin was a lifelong idealist, and most of his works focused on how to build our future after the revolution. His influence is found in our persistent focus on prefiguration.</p>

                <h3>Abdullah Öcalan</h3>
                <p><em>The Roots of Civilisation</em></p>
                <p>Abdullah Öcalan is a Kurdish-Turkish political leader. He created the governing ideology of the PKK; Democratic Confederalism. His work has been very influential in creating a liberation narrative independent of western thought. His analysis of women as the first, and universal colonised peoples inspired the deep-dive into hierarchy as seen in the manifesto. Abdullah Öcalan is still alive, currently imprisoned by Turkish forces following his kidnapping in the late 90s. His prison writings on decentralisation and informal hierarchy play an important role in the intersectional stance of this manifesto.</p>

                <h3>Jürgen Habermas</h3>
                <p><em>Between Facts & Norms</em></p>
                <p>Jürgen Habermas is a German sociologist best known for his work on human relationships; famously dividing them into personal and transactional. His work is confined to the democracy section, especially the inclusion of 'deliberation' in our definition.</p>

                <h3>Noam Chomsky</h3>
                <p><em>On Anarchism, Manufacturing Consent</em></p>
                <p>Noam Chomsky, arguably the most famous author in this section, is an American author and professor of the American Left. A self-described anarchist, his analysis of coercion and formal hierarchies play an important role in our understanding of formal hierarchies. Though we are more receptive to government, enough for us to not qualify as 'anarchists', Noam Chomsky's analysis of formal hierarchies is still more or less in line with our interpretation.</p>

                <h3>Carole Pateman</h3>
                <p><em>Participation and Democratic Theory, The Disorder of Women</em></p>
                <p>Carole Pateman is a British political scientist. Her works mostly concern women and feminism, and builds on 3rd wave feminism. Admittedly we haven't been able to explore as many of her works as we would like, and any future revisions of this manifesto will certainly be influenced by her work. Her intersectional recognition of informal hierarchies is paramount to our analysis, and her exploration of participatory democracy helped solidify our understanding of democracy into a cohesive structure.</p>

                <h3>The Situationist International</h3>
                <p><em>On the Poverty of Student Life, The Situationist Manifesto</em></p>
                <p>The Situationists were members of an avant-garde artistic, marxist, and libertarian movement in France, active from the 1960s and 1980s. Their main concern was The Spectacle, an idea that features in our manifesto. Initially very influenced by The Situationist International, The Gadfly diverged with their praxis as we slowly realised they were a bit arrogant and almost certainly off their rockers. They probably would've lambasted us for writing a satire publication; they would argue it plays into the veneer of The Spectacle. The Spectacle is not our chief concern either, that instead being The Career. Though sharing superficial similarities with The Situationist International, we are very different and hopefully, unlike The Situationists, we will succeed in our mission.</p>
